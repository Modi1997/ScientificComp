# Scientific Computing Exercises 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the **ScComp** repository! This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks featuring various scientific computing exercises that I’ve been practising. The primary focus is on **NumPy** and its wide range of functions, as well as simulations of **random walks** using Bernoulli and other equations.

## 🌟 Key Highlights:
- Comprehensive use of the **NumPy** library for array manipulation, mathematical computations, and random number generation.
- Simulations of **random walks** (Bernoulli distribution) and other stochastic models.
- Each notebook includes clear explanations to guide you through the solution and concepts.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- **NumPy Basics**: Array creation, manipulation, and advanced operations.
- **Random Walk Simulations**: Using random walks to simulate and analyze stochastic processes, including Bernoulli trials and more.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Applying numerical methods to solve equations and create simulations.
- **Functional Programming**: Explored functional programming concepts such as pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutability to enhance code efficiency and readability.
